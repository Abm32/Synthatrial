- Added configurable API URL

**Rationale:** Users need to understand the full scope of the modern UI capabilities when evaluating the platform.

### 3. `.kiro/steering/structure.md`

#### Entry Points Section
**Updated:** `app.py` description with complete feature list:
- Added py3Dmol + stmol for 3D visualization
- Listed specific Lottie animations
- Documented Inter font usage
- Specified 7 curated drugs with names
- Added multi-enzyme profiling details
- Included 3-stage pipeline visualization

### Curated Drug Database
The following 7 drugs are now documented as part of the curated database:
1. Warfarin (anticoagulant)
2. Clopidogrel (antiplatelet)
3. Codeine (opioid analgesic)
4. Ibuprofen (NSAID)
5. Metoprolol (beta-blocker)
6. Simvastatin (statin)
7. Irinotecan (chemotherapy)

### Multi-Enzyme Profiling
Documented support for 5 key pharmacogenomic markers:
1. CYP2D6 (4 metabolizer statuses)
2. CYP2C19 (4 metabolizer statuses)
3. CYP2C9 (3 metabolizer statuses)
4. UGT1A1 (3 metabolizer statuses)
5. SLCO1B1 (3 function levels)

### Pipeline Visualization
Documented 3-stage analysis pipeline:
1. **Patient Genetics** - Displays genetic profile and deterministic PGx results
2. **Similar Drugs Retrieved** - Shows RAG context from vector database
3. **Predicted Response + Risk** - Presents clinical interpretation and risk assessment

## Impact Assessment

### For Users
