## Technical Details

### VCF File Storage Strategy

**AWS EC2 Approach:**
- Store VCF files directly on EC2 EBS volume
- No S3 required for single-instance deployments
- Cost-effective: ~₹200/month for 30GB storage
- Simple volume mount: `-v $(pwd)/data:/app/data`

**Chromosomes Supported:**
| Chromosome | Size | Genes | Use Case |
|------------|------|-------|----------|
| chr22 | 200MB | CYP2D6 | Codeine, Tramadol, Antidepressants |
| chr10 | 700MB | CYP2C19, CYP2C9 | Clopidogrel, Warfarin, NSAIDs |
| chr12 | 700MB | SLCO1B1 | Statin myopathy |
| chr16 | 330MB | VKORC1 | Warfarin dosing |
| chr2 | 1.2GB | UGT1A1 | Irinotecan toxicity |
| **Total** | **~3GB** | **Big 3 + extras** | **60-70% drug coverage** |

### Docker Volume Mount

**Critical Configuration:**
```bash
docker run -d \
  --name synthatrial-app \
  -p 8501:8501 \
  --env-file .env \
  -v $(pwd)/data:/app/data \  # ← Volume mount for VCF files
  --restart unless-stopped \
  synthatrial:latest
```

**Why Volume Mount:**
- Container can access host filesystem
- VCF files persist across container restarts
- No need to rebuild image when updating VCF files
- Efficient storage management

## Cost Comparison

| Platform | Monthly Cost | VCF Support | Best For |
|----------|--------------|-------------|----------|
| Render.com | Free - ₹500 | ❌ No | Demos, API only |
| Vercel | Free - ₹1000 | ❌ No | Serverless, API |
| Heroku | ₹500 - ₹2000 | ⚠️ Limited | Simple apps |
| **AWS EC2** | **₹400 - ₹850** | **✅ Full** | **Production** |

**AWS EC2 Breakdown:**
- t3.micro instance: ₹400-600/month
- 30GB EBS storage: ₹200/month
- Data transfer: ₹50/month
- **Total: ₹650-850/month**

## Migration Path

### From Render/Vercel to AWS EC2

**When to migrate:**
- Need VCF file support
- Want full pharmacogenomics analysis
- Require Big 3 enzymes + VKORC1
- Need production-grade deployment

**Migration steps:**
1. Launch EC2 instance (30 minutes)
2. Download VCF files (15-30 minutes)
3. Deploy Docker container (10 minutes)
4. Test full pipeline (5 minutes)
5. Update DNS/documentation (5 minutes)

**Total migration time:** ~1-2 hours

---

## Future Enhancements

### Optional S3 Integration

**When to add S3:**
- Multiple EC2 instances
- Auto-scaling requirements
- Shared VCF storage across regions
- Backup and disaster recovery

**Benefits:**
- Centralized VCF storage
- No duplication across instances
- Easier updates and versioning
- Better for multi-region deployments

**Implementation:**
```bash
# Download VCF from S3 on container start
aws s3 sync s3://synthatrial-vcf/genomes/ /app/data/genomes/
```

---

## Documentation Consistency

All steering documentation files now consistently reference:

✅ **Four deployment options:** Render, Vercel, Heroku, AWS EC2
✅ **AWS EC2 as production option** with VCF support
✅ **Complete deployment guide** in `AWS_EC2_DEPLOYMENT.md`
✅ **Cost-effective strategy** for full-featured deployment
✅ **Volume mounting** for VCF file access

## Impact Assessment

### Benefits

1. **Complete Production Deployment:** Full VCF support with all chromosomes
2. **Cost-Effective:** ₹650-850/month vs enterprise cloud solutions
3. **Simple Architecture:** No S3 complexity for single-instance deployments
4. **Docker Best Practices:** Volume mounting for data persistence
5. **Comprehensive Documentation:** Step-by-step guide with troubleshooting

### Considerations

1. **Setup Time:** Longer than Render/Vercel (30-45 minutes vs 5-10 minutes)
2. **Maintenance:** Requires EC2 instance management
3. **Scaling:** Single instance initially (can add load balancer later)
4. **Storage:** Limited to EC2 disk size (expandable as needed)

---

## Conclusion

The steering documentation has been successfully updated to reflect the new AWS EC2 deployment option. This provides users with a production-ready deployment path that includes full VCF support while maintaining cost-effectiveness and simplicity.

**Key Achievement:** Platform now supports both quick demo deployments (Render/Vercel) and full production deployments (AWS EC2) with comprehensive documentation for each approach.

---

**Documentation Status:** ✅ Complete and Consistent
**Next Steps:** Users can now choose deployment option based on their needs (demo vs production)
