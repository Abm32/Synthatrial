**Updated:** Cloud-based Deployment description to include:
- Specific cost range (₹0-₹750/month)
- Comparison with managed services
- Emphasis on economical production deployment

**Rationale:** Use cases should include cost considerations for production deployments.

### 3. `.kiro/steering/structure.md`

#### Competition and Demo Files Section
**Updated:** AWS_EC2_DEPLOYMENT.md description to include:
- Cost range (₹0-₹750/month)
- Explanation of cost-effective strategy
- Comparison with expensive managed services

**Rationale:** File descriptions should explain the value and purpose of documentation.

## Key Information Added

### Deployment Cost Comparison Table

| Platform | Cost | VCF Support | Setup Time | Best For |
|----------|------|-------------|------------|----------|

4. **Stop instance when not needed** - No compute charges
5. **Download only chr22 initially** - Save storage costs

### Cost Breakdown

**Free Tier (First 12 months):**
- t2.micro instance: ₹0/month
- Storage (15-30GB): ₹75-₹150/month
