## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Set these in your repository settings under **Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions**:

```bash
# Required for container registry
GITHUB_TOKEN  # Automatically provided

# Optional for enhanced features
DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME    # Docker Hub deployment
DOCKER_HUB_TOKEN       # Docker Hub authentication
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL      # Slack notifications
TEAMS_WEBHOOK_URL      # Teams notifications
```

### Workflow Customization

#### Build Configuration
```yaml
# In docker-build.yml
env:
  REGISTRY: ghcr.io                    # Container registry
  IMAGE_NAME: ${{ github.repository }} # Image name
  PLATFORMS: linux/amd64,linux/arm64  # Target platforms
```

#### Security Thresholds
```yaml
# In security-scan.yml
inputs:
  severity_threshold:
    default: 'medium'  # low, medium, high, critical
```

#### Test Configuration
```yaml
# Test timeouts and parallelization
pytest --timeout=300 --maxfail=5 -x
```

## Usage Examples

### Manual Workflow Dispatch

#### Trigger Security Scan
```bash
# Via GitHub CLI
gh workflow run security-scan.yml \
  -f scan_type=all \
  -f severity_threshold=high

# Via GitHub UI
# Go to Actions > Security Scanning > Run workflow
```

#### Trigger Release
```bash
# Via GitHub CLI
gh workflow run release.yml \
  -f version=v1.2.0 \
  -f environment=staging

# Create release via GitHub UI
# Go to Releases > Create a new release
```

#### Force Docker Rebuild
```bash
# Via GitHub CLI
gh workflow run docker-build.yml \
  -f force_rebuild=true \
  -f skip_tests=false
```

### Workflow Status Badges

```

## Workflow Artifacts

Each workflow generates artifacts for debugging and reporting:

### Build Artifacts
- `test-results-*` - Test execution results and coverage
- `security-reports` - Security scan results
- `container-security-scan` - Container vulnerability reports
- `build-report` - Comprehensive build summary

### Security Artifacts
- `code-security-reports` - Source code security analysis
- `dependency-security-reports` - Dependency vulnerability reports
- `container-security-reports-*` - Container security scans
- `security-summary-report` - Consolidated security report

### Release Artifacts
- `release-security-report` - Release-specific security scan
- `release-report` - Release deployment summary

### PR Artifacts
- `pr-security-reports` - PR-specific security analysis
- `pr-summary` - Pull request validation summary

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Build Failures
```bash
# Check build logs
gh run view --log

# Re-run failed jobs
gh run rerun --failed
```

#### Security Scan Failures
```bash
# View security reports
gh run download <run-id> -n security-summary-report

# Check specific vulnerability
trivy image --format table synthatrial:latest
```

#### Multi-Architecture Build Issues
```bash
# Test local multi-arch build
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 -t test .

# Check buildx setup
docker buildx ls
```

### Performance Optimization

#### Faster Builds
- Use build cache: `cache-from: type=gha`
- Parallel test execution: `pytest -n auto`
- Skip tests for documentation changes: `if: needs.pr-info.outputs.has_code_changes == 'true'`

#### Resource Management
- Adjust timeouts: `timeout-minutes: 30`
- Limit concurrent jobs: `max-parallel: 2`
- Use matrix strategy for parallel execution

## Integration with SynthaTrial

### Docker Integration
The workflows integrate with SynthaTrial's Docker infrastructure:
- Uses existing Dockerfiles (`docker/Dockerfile.dev`, `docker/Dockerfile.prod`)
- Leverages docker-compose configurations
- Integrates with Makefile commands

### Testing Integration
- Runs existing test suites (`tests/validation_tests.py`, `tests/quick_test.py`)
- Executes property-based tests with Hypothesis
- Validates containerized environments

### Security Integration
- Uses SynthaTrial's security scanner (`scripts/security_scanner.py`)
- Integrates with existing monitoring (`scripts/production_monitor.py`)
- Validates SSL certificate management

## Monitoring and Alerts

- Slack/Teams integration for notifications

### Performance Monitoring
- Build time tracking
- Test execution metrics
- Container startup performance

### Security Monitoring
- Daily vulnerability scans
- Dependency update notifications
- Critical vulnerability alerts

## Best Practices
