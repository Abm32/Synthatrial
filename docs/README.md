# Documentation

All project documentation lives in the **root [README.md](../README.md)**.

It covers: quick start, data (VCF + ChEMBL, **PGx curated data** in `data/pgx/` with PharmVar/CPIC sources and versioning), deployment, commands (including **benchmark** and **update_pgx_data**), architecture (deterministic CYP2C19, allele_caller), project structure, troubleshooting, requirements, and resources (PharmVar, CPIC, PharmGKB, Ensembl).
